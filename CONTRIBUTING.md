## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

- üêõ **Bug fixes**: Fix issues or bugs in the codebase
- ‚ú® **New features**: Implement new functionality
- üìù **Documentation**: Improve README, code comments, or examples
- üé® **Code quality**: Refactoring, performance improvements
- üß™ **Tests**: Add or improve test coverage
- üí° **Ideas**: Suggest new features or improvements

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

Create a feature branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` - for new features
- `fix/` - for bug fixes
- `docs/` - for documentation updates
- `refactor/` - for code refactoring
- `test/` - for test additions/improvements

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Follow the existing code style
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Test Your Changes

Before submitting, ensure all checks pass:

```bash
# Run tests
cargo test

# Check formatting
cargo fmt -- --check

# Run linter
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Build release version
cargo build --release
```

### 4. Keep Your Branch Updated

Regularly sync with the upstream repository:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

## Coding Standards

### Rust Style Guidelines

- Follow the official [Rust Style Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/)
- Use `cargo fmt` to format your code
- Address all `cargo clippy` warnings
- Write idiomatic Rust code

### Code Quality

- **Clarity**: Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- **Comments**: Add doc comments (`///`) for public APIs
- **Error Handling**: Use proper Result/Option types, avoid unwrap() in library code
- **Performance**: Consider performance implications, but prioritize readability
- **Safety**: Avoid unsafe code unless absolutely necessary (and document why)

### Documentation

- Add doc comments for all public functions, structs, and modules
- Include examples in doc comments when helpful
- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Update CHANGELOG.md following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format

## Testing

### Writing Tests

- Add unit tests in the same file as the code (`#[cfg(test)]` module)
- Add integration tests in `tests/` directory
- Aim for high test coverage, especially for core functionality
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Test Examples

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_feature() {
        // Arrange
        let input = "test";
        
        // Act
        let result = function_under_test(input);
        
        // Assert
        assert_eq!(result, expected_output);
    }
}
```
