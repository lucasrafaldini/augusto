## Resource Requirements

### Development
- 1-2 core maintainers (5-10 hrs/week)
- Community contributors (optional)
- Code review capacity

### Infrastructure
- GitHub Actions (free tier sufficient)
- Crates.io hosting (free)
- Domain for website (~$12/year)
- Optional: Documentation hosting (free on GitHub Pages)

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Performance bottlenecks**: Mitigate with benchmarking and optimization
- **Large input handling**: Implement limits and warnings
- **Dictionary size**: Use efficient data structures (tries, bloom filters)

### Community Risks
- **Low adoption**: Focus on marketing and unique features
- **Contributor burnout**: Set realistic goals, encourage small contributions
- **Scope creep**: Maintain clear roadmap, defer non-essential features

### Mitigation Strategies
- Regular releases to maintain momentum
- Clear contribution guidelines
- Good communication with community
- Focus on core features first

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a clear path from the current v0.1.x state to a mature, feature-rich v1.0.0 release. The project has strong foundations and exciting potential for growth in the intersection of programming, linguistics, and creative writing.

**Priority Focus**: Complete v0.2.0 features with emphasis on usability, performance, and community building.
